\begin{abstract}
We present evidence for the existence of the splashback radius
in galaxy clusters selected using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.
We show that the deprojected cross-correlation of galaxy clusters
found in the Planck survey with galaxies detected photometrically in
the Pan-STARRS survey, shows a sharp steepening feature (a
logarithmic slope steeper than $-3$), which we associate with the
splashback radius.  We infer the three-dimensional splashback radius
for the SZ cluster sample to be $r_{\rm sp}=1.85_{-0.30}^{+0.26}$ $\mpch$,
where the cluster sample has an average halo mass $M_{\rm
500c}=3.0\times10^{14}\msunh$ at an average redshift of $z=0.18$.
The inferred value of the splashback radius is consistent with the
expected location for dark matter halos in the standard cold dark
matter paradigm. However, given the limited precision of our
measurements, we cannot conclusively rule out the smaller splashback
radius measured so far in the literature for photometrically
selected galaxy clusters. We show that the splashback radius does
not depend upon the galaxy magnitude for galaxies fainter than
$M_i-5\log h=-19.44$, and is present at a consistent location in
galaxy populations divided by color. The presence of the splashback radius in
the blue galaxy population could potentially be used to put lower limits on the
quenching timescales for galaxies. However, these results need further
verification with deeper datasets, as photometric errors could cause
contamination of blue galaxies with red galaxies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

The density distribution of matter within dark matter halos shapes
the potential well in which galaxies form and grow. Therefore, the
structure of these dark matter halos has been extensively studied
both theoretically as well as in numerical simulations \citep[see
e.g.,][]{gunn1972infall, fillmore1984self, bertschinger1985self,
navarro1997universal, moore1999dark}. Studies with numerical
simulations show that the density profiles of dark matter halos
within their virial radii are roughly self-similar and follow the
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile \citep{navarro1997universal},
which asymptotes to a slope of $-1$ in the inner regions and $-3$ at
large radii. There has been intense debate in the literature about
the exact form of the density profile 
\citep[e.g.,][]{navarro2004inner}, the value of the asymptotic inner slope,
as well as the outskirts and boundaries of dark matter halos
\citep{cuesta2008virialized, more2011overdensity, diemer2013pseudo}. 

The recent study of \citet{diemer2014dependence} has sparked a
renewed interest in understanding the structure of dark matter halos
on scales beyond the typical virial radii.
\citet{diemer2014dependence} investigated the outskirts of dark
matter halos in numerical simulations and found the existence of a
physical feature, namely a sharp steepening in the density
distributions of dark matter halos, which is not captured by
commonly used functional forms such as the NFW profile. They showed
that even for halos of the same mass, the position of the feature
changes depending upon the mass accretion rate of the halos. A simple
theoretical toy model to explain this feature was presented by
\citet{adhikari2014splashback}. They showed that the feature
observed by \citet{diemer2014dependence} results from the  piling up
of recently accreted dark matter particles at the apocenters of
their orbits, and its location corresponds to the last density
caustic in the self-similar models of secondary infall
\citep{fillmore1984self, bertschinger1985self, lithwick2011self}.
They coined the term ``splashback radius`` for this feature. Their
toy model also naturally explains the accretion rate dependence --
faster accreting halos have smaller splashback radii. 

The interpretation of the accretion rate dependence is
straightforward. Due to the continuous change of the gravitational
potential of the halo, depending on its accretion rate, the kinetic
energy of a recently accreted dark matter particle, gained during
its infall onto the cluster, does not suffice to climb the deepened
potential well completely again, but instead it ``splashes back`` at
a distance that depends on the recent deepening of the potential
well.

Subsequently, \citet{more2015splashback} studied the
growth rate of dark matter halos at low redshift and showed that
pseudo-evolution, caused by the ill-definition of the halo boundary
through the virial radius, accounts for nearly all of the apparent
growth of galaxy-sized halos and can also account for a substantial
fraction of the growth of cluster-sized halos
\citep{diemer2013pseudo}. They suggested the use of the splashback
radius as a natural boundary for dark matter halos and explored its
consequences for the inferred boundaries and growth rates of the
halos.  It was found that depending on the accretion rate of the
halo, the splashback radius may lie well beyond the commonly used
virial radius. For quickly accreting halos the splashback radius is
expected to occur at $\approx 0.8-1$ $r_{\mathrm{200m}}$ and at
$\approx 1.5$ $r_{\mathrm{200m}}$ for slowly accreting halos
\citep{more2015splashback}.

Given the mass of the halo, the location of the splashback radius
constitutes a direct probe of the halo accretion rate. Motivated by
these studies, \citet{more2016detection} tried to detect this
feature in observations. Using the optically selected Sloan Digital
Sky Survey RedMaPPer galaxy cluster catalog
\citep{rykoff2014redmapper}, and by cross-correlating it with the
SDSS photometric galaxy sample, \citet{more2016detection} found evidence
for the steepening of the dark matter density profile, and therefore
the splashback radius of this sample of galaxy clusters (later
corroborated by including further models for mis-centering by
\citet{baxter2017halo}). Somewhat surprisingly,
\citet{more2016detection} found that the location of the splashback
radius was inconsistent with that expected from numerical
simulations of dark matter by about $20\pm5$\%. Although they
investigated potential systematic issues, they did not have access
to mock cluster catalogs which could mimic the selection effects of
optically-identified clusters. \citet{busch2017assembly} used a
simplified optical cluster selection algorithm on the Millennium
simulation, and pointed out that optical clusters can be heavily
affected by projection issues, and could potentially introduce
systematics in the inference of the splashback radius, as well as
halo assembly bias. The existence of projection effects in the
optical cluster catalog in the context of halo assembly bias was 
also demonstrated by \citet{zu2016level}.

\citet{umetsu2017lensing} as well as \citet{contigiani2018weak} 
used Xray selected clusters to look for the splashback radius 
using the weak lensing signal, however
stacking issues and the low signal-to-noise ratio remains a significant
hurdle for both of them. \citet{chang2017splashback} found evidence for the splashback
radius in the weak lensing signal, but their analysis was again done
using optically selected clusters in the Dark energy survey
\citep{dark2005dark}. Regardless of the projection issues present in
the optical cluster catalog, there is some inherent circularity
present in the logic of using photometric galaxies to select
clusters as over-densities in a given aperture, and then using the
same photometric sample of galaxies to look for the splashback
radius. There is a possibility that the aperture used to select the
cluster catalogs could be imprinted in a non-trivial way on the measured number
density profiles of clusters. {\bf Add citation to the more recent Xray paper
by Henk Hoekstra and collaborators as well.}

In this work, we move away from the optical cluster selection and
explore the use of SZ selected cluster catalogs. While the SZ
selected clusters can also be susceptible to systematic selection
effects, the scales on which the SZ signal is measured and the
cluster selection is performed is much smaller than the expected
location of the splashback radius. Therefore, we do not expect major
systematic biases due to the selection process. We use this sample
to explore the evidence for the splashback radius in observations.
Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the weak lensing signal, we
perform our analysis using cross-correlation of galaxies with
clusters instead. The SDSS sample used by \citet{more2016detection}
was deep enough such that biases in the location of the splashback
radius due to dynamical friction effects were expected to be small.
Nevertheless, we use galaxy samples, which are even fainter by
$0.5-1$ magnitudes compared to those used by
\citet{more2016detection}.

Given that the splashback radius represents a true halo boundary,
the observations of the splashback radius can be used to study a
variety of galaxy formation questions. Such as questions 
regarding the timescales and the spatial scales within
which star forming galaxies quench after they fall into the cluster
potential. Answers to those questions are important to understand 
the evolution of satellite galaxies in massive galaxy clusters. 
If blue galaxies quench before
they complete a single orbit, then they are not expected to show a
splashback feature in their density distribution. In pursuit of this
question, we also explore the dependence of the cluster-galaxy
cross-correlations separately for the red and blue galaxy populations 
and explore their relative contributions to the overall density profile.

This paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:Methods} starts
by introducing the data, namely the cluster and the galaxy catalogs
as well as the methods that are used to derive the results which are
presented in visual and tabular form and  discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:Results}. We outline the steps that will be taken
in future works in Section~\ref{sec:Future} and finally we summarize
our findings in Section~\ref{sec:Conclusions} and provide a short
outlook on what needs yet to be done. Throughout the paper, we use a
flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.27$ to convert
redshifts and angles into cosmological distances. Also, we denote 
three-dimensional distances by $r$ and projected distances by $R$.


\section{Data and Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}
The methodology we adopt for locating the splashback radius closely
follows \citet{more2016detection}. We perform a cross-correlation
between SZ selected galaxy clusters with photometric galaxies in
order to assess the existence and location of the splashback radius.
We describe the data sets we use and our methodology in this
section.


\subsection{Cluster catalog}
\label{sec:clusters}
The baryonic component of a galaxy cluster is dominated by the hot,
ionized  intra-cluster medium (ICM), which is gravitationally bound
within the cluster. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons
that pass through the cluster inverse Compton scatter off the hot
electrons and gain energy. This effect is known as the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect
\citep{sunyaev1970small,sunyaev1980velocity}. The effect has a
characteristic frequency dependence and results in an intensity
decrease below 220 GHz and an associated increase at higher
frequencies. The multiple frequency channels on the Planck satellite
allow a detection of galaxy clusters using the SZ effect
\citep{collaboration2016planck}. As part of the 2015 Data Release of
the Planck mission, the second Planck Catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich
Sources (PSZ2) was made available to the community. The PSZ2 catalog
contains detections based on  three different techniques
\citep{ade2016planck}, and the union of these catalogs has in total
1653 galaxy clusters, of which 1203 clusters have been confirmed by
cross-matching to other galaxy clusters from external data sets.

\citet{ade2014planck}. The missing mass estimates as well as the
expected values of the splashback radii were calculated using the
Python package COLOSSUS \citep{diemer2017colossus}. The predictions
for the splashback radii $r^{\mathrm{3D,theo}}_{\mathrm{sp}}$ are

The 1-$\sigma$ errors on the cluster positions are $\sim1.6\arcmin$
and the estimated purity of the catalog has a lower limit of 83\%
(probability that a detection corresponds to a real object). The
integrated Compton Y-parameter $Y_{500c}$ of each of the clusters
are also provided. Based on the scaling relation between $Y_{500c}$
and $M_{500c}$ \citep{ade2014planck} the mass estimates $M_{500c}$
of the clusters are calculated
\citep{adam2016planck,collaboration2016planck}. The PSZ2 union
cluster catalog is publicly available from the \fnurl{\textit{Planck
Legacy Archive}}{https://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/\# home}.

We restrict ourselves to the redshift range $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.33$
in order to mimic the redshift range used by
\citet{more2016detection}. Due to the large beam size of the Planck
satellite, the cluster positions as reported in the catalog may be
mis-centered from the true centers of the galaxy clusters. We perform
a visual inspection of Pan-STARRS images taken around the detected
galaxy clusters in order to locate the nearest, brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG). We regard the position of the BCG as the true cluster
location, under the assumption that the BCG is located at the true,
gravitational center. Due to this crude assumption, we additionally 
study the effects of a possible, remaining mis-centering of the 
cluster positions in our model for the two-dimensional correlation 
function (see Appendix~\ref{sec:mis-centering}). 

The final sample that we use consists of 596
galaxy clusters and is about an order of magnitude smaller compared
to the sample used in \citet{more2016detection}. The sample we use
in this paper has an average redshift of 0.177, and an average
cluster mass $M_{500c}$ of about $3.0 \cdot 10^{14}
h^{-1}$M$_{\sun}$. In Table~\ref{tab:cluster_catalogs} we compare
the main properties of the cluster catalog used in this work to that
used by \citet{more2016detection}. A map of the sky positions of the clusters
can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:planck_fig} in
Appendix~\ref{sec:figures}. 

\citet{kosyra2015environment} found no evidence for a significant
correlation between the density of Planck detections and the
weighted average noise of all Planck channels at $z<0.5$. Since we
restrict ourselves to $z<0.33$, we utilize the selection mask of the
PSZ2 union catalog in order to construct a random galaxy cluster
catalog, which is roughly one order of magnitude larger than the
original catalog. The redshifts of these random objects are drawn
from the parent cluster catalog in order to match the redshift
distribution of the original cluster catalog. 

\subsection{Galaxy catalog}
\label{sec:galaxies}
The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System
(Pan-STARRS) is a wide-field astronomical imaging and data
processing facility operated by the University of Hawaii's Institute
for Astronomy \citep{kaiser2002pan,kaiser2010pan}. We use data from
the 3$\pi$ Steradian Survey carried out with this facility, which
was released as part of Data Release 1 (DR1). The survey covers the
entire sky north of $\delta=-31\degr$ (in ICRS coordinates) in five
broadband filters ($g_{\mathrm{P1}}, r_{\mathrm{P1}},
i_{\mathrm{P1}}, z_{\mathrm{P1}}, y_{\mathrm{P1}}$) with multiple
pointings. The mean 5$\sigma$ point source limiting sensitivities
amount to (23.3, 23.2, 23.1, 22.3, 21.4) magnitudes for the
individual bands, respectively. 

For the visual inspection and centering of the clusters, we use the
Pan-Starrs $gri$ \textit{stack} images around each cluster position.
The galaxy catalog is obtained from the  \textit{StackObjectThin}
table, which is publicly available on the \fnurl{\textit{Barbara A.
Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes}
(MAST)}{http://archive.stsci.edu/}. To select only objects detected
with acceptable precision we restrict our search to those objects
which have been flagged as \textit{BestDetection}s. We further
restrict the catalog to objects flagged as
\textit{PrimaryDetection}s in order to select unique objects. This
is necessary since the survey is divided into overlapping
\textit{projectioncells} and \textit{skycells}, which causes some objects
to be listed multiple times.

The magnitudes of the selected objects are then corrected for the
extinction caused by the dust present in the Milky Way. This is done
using the \fnurl{mwdust}{https://github.com/jobovy/mwdust} Python
module provided by \citet{bovy2016galactic}. The extinction
correction is performed using a dust map combining the measurements
of \citet{marshall2006modelling}, \citet{green2015three} and
\citet{drimmel2003three}. Only objects with an extinction corrected
$i_{\mathrm{P1}}$ band Kron magnitude brighter than 22.0 are
selected from the catalog. This results in a galaxy catalog
consisting out of 1'155'285'728 objects. Starting from this catalog
three different sub-catalogs named PS 21, PS 21.5 and PS 22 with a
survey depth of 21.0, 21.5 and 22.0 magnitudes, respectively are
constructed.

As mentioned in the description of the Pan-STARRS survey by
\citet{chambers2016pan} there is a significant variation in the
depth of the 3$\pi$ Steradian survey even on small scales. In order
to avoid choosing objects in shallow regions of the survey the
minimal observed Kron magnitude in the $i_{\mathrm{P1}}$ band in
each \textit{skycell} is recorded and only objects in skycells with
a minimal observed Kron magnitude of 21.0, 21.5 and 22.0 or brighter
are selected depending on the corresponding catalog. Since most of
the shallow regions lie in the galactic plane, we mask out the
region at low galactic latitudes $|b|<20\degr$. The resultant
HEALPix maps showing the excluded areas on the sky can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:heal_map}. We further disregard objects in bad
pixel regions as indicated by the $i_{\mathrm{P1}}$ band
\textit{stack.mask} images.

At this point of the analysis, our object catalogs contain both
galaxies and stars. The 3$\pi$ Steradian Survey provides both the
Kron and PSF model based magnitudes for each object. These
magnitudes are expected to be similar for stars while the Kron
magnitudes are brighter for galaxies. Therefore, we flag all objects
with a value of $i_{\mathrm{P1,PSF}} - i_{\mathrm{P1,Kron}}< 0.05$
as stars \citep{farrow2013pan}. Despite this cut, bright, close-by
stars at magnitudes brighter than 13.5 tend to be classified as
extended objects \citep{chambers2016pan}. To avoid contamination of
the galaxy catalog due to such bright stars, we further remove all
objects with $i_{\mathrm{P1,PSF}} < 15.0$. Since there are very few
galaxies at such low magnitudes this does not introduce a selection
bias. We list the main characteristics of the galaxy catalogs we
have used in Table~\ref{tab:galaxy_catalogs}.

\subsection{Estimation of the spatial density profile}
\label{sec:estimators}

We use the Davis-Peebles estimator \citep{davis1983survey} to
compute the cross-correlation between our galaxy clusters and
galaxies. This estimator can be written as
\begin{equation}
\xi_{\rm 2D}(R) = \frac{\rm D_1D_2-R_1D_2}{\rm R_1D_2}\,
\end{equation}
where D$_1$D$_2$ and R$_1$D$_2$ are the normalized numbers of
cluster-galaxy pairs and cluster randoms-galaxy pairs at a given
comoving projected separation $R$. The subtraction of the signal
around random cluster positions gets rid of the uncorrelated pairs and allows
us to estimate the projected cross-correlation. The uncertainty in the galaxy
distribution masks prevents us from using the Landy-Szalay estimator \citep{landy1993bias}. 
{\bf Cite Landy-Szalay paper.}

Given the flux limited galaxy catalog that we use, we expect to
observe more correlated galaxies in galaxy clusters that lie closer
to us, but with much fainter absolute magnitudes. To avoid
such biases with redshift of the clusters we restrict ourselves to
galaxies with absolute magnitudes brighter than a certain magnitude
limit, which depends on the depth of the used galaxy catalog. We
make the assumption that the galaxies reside at the redshift of the
cluster in question. The used magnitude limits are (-19.44, -18.94
and -18.44) for the catalogs PS 21, PS 21.5 and PS 22, respectively.

We use the functional form of \citet{diemer2014dependence} in order
to model our two-dimensional correlation function measurements. This
functional form consists of an inner Einasto profile and an outer
power law profile connected by a smooth transition
\begin{align}
\xi_{\rm 3D}(r) &= \rho_{\mathrm{in}}(r)f_{\mathrm{trans}}(r) + \rho_{\mathrm{out}}(r)\,, \label{eq:model} \\
\rho_{\mathrm{in}}(r)&=\rho_{\mathrm{s}}\exp\left( -\frac{2}{\alpha}\left[ \left( \frac{r}{r_{\mathrm{s}}}\right)^{\alpha}-1 \right] \right)\,,\\
\rho_{\mathrm{out}}(r)&=\rho_{\mathrm{0}}\left( \frac{r}{r_{\mathrm{out}}}\right)^{-s_{\mathrm{e}}} \,,\\
f_{\mathrm{trans}}(r)&=\left( 1+\left( \frac{r}{r_{\mathrm{t}}} \right)^{\beta} \right)^{-\gamma/ \beta}\,,
\label{eq:dk14}
\end{align}
where $r$ indicates the three-dimensional radial distance from the
halo center \citep{diemer2014dependence}. We model the
two-dimensional correlation function, $\xi_{\rm 2D}$ as an integral
over the three-dimensional correlation function
\begin{equation}
\xi_{\rm 2D}(R)=\frac{1}{R_{\rm max}}\int^{R_{\mathrm{max}}}_0 \xi_{\rm 3D}(\sqrt{R^2+x^2}) dx \,
\label{eq:surface}
\end{equation}
where we adopt $R_{\mathrm{max}}=40$ $h^{-1}$Mpc for the maximum projection
length. Variations of this length do not change the location of the
splashback radius appreciably as tested in
\citet{more2016detection}. The functional form adopted in
Equation~\ref{eq:surface} has nine model parameters,
$\rho_{\mathrm{s}}, \alpha, r_{\mathrm{s}}, r_{\mathrm{out}},
\rho_{\mathrm{0}}, s_{\mathrm{e}}, r_{\mathrm{t}}, \beta$ and
$\gamma$. Given the perfect degeneracy between the parameters
$r_{\mathrm{out}}$ and $\rho_{\rm o}$, we fix $r_{\mathrm{out}}=1.5$ $
h^{-1}$Mpc. 

Therefore the model is described by eight model parameters.
We infer the posterior distributions of those parameters by fitting the model for the two-dimensional correlation
function to the measured two-dimensional correlation signal. 
We use the affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler of \citet{goodman2010ensemble} as
implemented in the parallel python package {\it emcee} by
\citet{foreman2013emcee}. We adopt priors similar to
\citet{more2016detection} on some of our parameters based on the
expectations of their values from numerical simulations, but double
the scales of the normal priors compared to their work (see
Table~\ref{tab:priors}). The central value for the prior on $\alpha$
is deduced from mass estimates \citep{gao2008redshift}, whereas the
central values on the priors of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ were
recommended by \citet{diemer2014dependence}.

The splashback radius for galaxy cluster scale halos is consistent
with the location of the steepest logarithmic slope of the density
profile. We estimate the steepest slope of both the two-dimensional
and the three-dimensional cross-correlation function. The two
locations of the steepest slope are expected to be different by
about 20\% for typical cluster halo parameters
\citep{diemer2014dependence, more2016detection}.

Mis-centering of the central cluster positions can heavily affect 
the small-scale correlation function on scales smaller than the typical mis-centering distance. 
Although, the splashback radius is located at much larger scales, 
the change of the inner part of the correlation function can alter the model fit significantly. 
Mis-centering effects are not expected to change the location of the splashback feature 
but they can in principle decrease the significance of the evidence for the splashback feature \citep{baxter2017halo}.
We discuss the modelling of mis-centering and its effects on the inferred splashback radii in Appendix~\ref{sec:mis-centering}.
\subsection{Separation of red and blue galaxies}
\label{sec:Color}

We are also interested in measuring the cluster-galaxy
cross-correlations for the blue and the red galaxy samples
separately. We use a $g_{\mathrm{P1}}-r_{\mathrm{P1}}$ color cut
which varies with the redshift of the clusters in order to account
for the k-corrections, which cannot be computed individually for
each galaxy.

In order to compute the color cut to be used, we first match spectroscopic
galaxies in the Sloan digital Sky Survey (DR 13) ({\bf which data release?}) to their
Pan-STARRS photometry. We bin these galaxies in narrow redshift bins and
produce a histogram of the $g_{\mathrm{P1}}-r_{\mathrm{P1}}$ colors of the
galaxies in each bin. Due to the presence of the $4000\AA$-break present in the
red galaxy population, the two galaxy populations separate in such histograms
into two populations and we fit a double Gaussian distribution to it.  Based on
the fitted distribution we put a cut in color to exclude a contamination of the
blue population by incorrectly characterized red galaxies with a confidence of
3$\sigma$. We repeat this procedure for each redshift bin, to obtain a redshift
dependent color cut that separates the red from the blue population minimizing
the contamination of the blue population by red galaxies. Although being much
simpler and faster than calculating the individual k-corrections for each
galaxy, this procedure has its own shortcomings as discussed in
Appendix~\ref{sec:Errors}, in particular due to the photometric errors of red
galaxies. We would therefore exercise appropriate caution while interpreting
the results obtained by dividing galaxies in to color bins.

In our analysis, the same galaxy may be considered red or blue depending upon
the cluster redshift under consideration. Our method avoids the use of
uncertain photometric redshifts to derive k-corrections
\citep[cf.][]{baxter2017halo}. We will study the cross-correlations to derive
the splashback radii for these galaxy populations separately, as well as the
fractional contributions of the red and the blue galaxies to the total density
profile as a function of radius. The caveats in the interpretation of these
results are mentioned in the Appendix~\ref{sec:Errors}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}
\subsection{Cluster-galaxy cross-correlations}
The measurements of the two-dimensional cluster-galaxy
cross-correlations are shown as black points with error bars in the
left column of Figure~\ref{fig:2D_graphs}. The different rows
correspond to the three different absolute magnitude limits that we
have used to select all the galaxies when calculating the
cross-correlations. The cross-correlation signal is clearly detected
in all three measurements and the corresponding signal-to-noise
ratios of the measurements are listed in Table~\ref{tab:snr}.

We fit these measurements with our parametric model in Equation~\ref{eq:surface}
and compute the posterior distribution of the model parameters 
as described in Section~\ref{sec:estimators}. The
median of the MCMC fit is indicated by the central solid line, while
the shaded area marks the 68\% credible interval for the fit. The
median values of the posterior distributions of the parameters along
with their 68\% confidence intervals are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:fit_parameters} along with their minimal, reduced
$\chi^2$ values. The two-dimensional posterior distributions for
each pair of parameters are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:corner_21},
\ref{fig:corner_21.5} and \ref{fig:corner_22} for the three absolute
magnitude limits, respectively.

The right panels in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_graphs} show the

cross-correlations and the 68\% confidence interval based on our
model fits. The logarithmic derivatives show a distinct steepening
feature at around $1.3~\mpch$. The figure shows that the
location of the steepest slope does not change appreciably when the
magnitude limit is changed, even though we use a sample which is one
magnitude brighter than $M_{\rm i}-5\log h=-19.44$. The 68\%
confidence interval of the location of the steepest slope is
indicated by the vertical, shaded region. We also show the location
of the virial radius $r_{\mathrm{200m}}$ based on the Planck SZ mass estimate 
as a black, dotted line in each panel.

We use the posterior distributions of our model parameters to infer
the three-dimensional cross-correlation and its first and second order logarithmic
derivatives. These inferences along with the corresponding 68\%
confidence intervals are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:3D_graphs},
maintaining the same color scheme as in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_graphs}
for ease of comparison. The three-dimensional cross-correlations
also show significant steepening in each of the cases that we have
explored, reaching logarithmic derivatives steeper than $-3$. The
inferred 68\% confidence regions of the locations of the steepest
slope of the three-dimensional cross-correlations are shown with
vertical, shaded regions in each panel. The posterior
distributions of the locations of the steepest slope in the
two-dimensional and three-dimensional cross-correlations can be
found in the left hand and the right hand panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:splashback}, respectively. The estimates of the splashback radii
for each of the samples are listed in Table~\ref{tab:fit_parameters}
and our results show that the location of the splashback radius does
not depend upon the sample once we use galaxies fainter than $M_{\rm
i}-5\log h=-19.44$. Our measurements have an accuracy of $\sim$15\%.

{\bf Dominik, we need to add in the first and second derivative of just the one
halo term to these plots $\rho_{\rm in}\,f_{\rm trans}$. Also highlight that
the slope is dropping down precipitously within a factor 2 in radius. Mention
that in the next paragraph. Add in Figure~\ref{fig:derivatives}, the second
derivative posterior as well. In fact you can leave out the current left hand
panel and just plot the the first and second derivatives of $\log\rho_{\rm
in}\,f_{\rm trans}$.}

Following \citet{baxter2017halo}, we also present the values of the
logarithmic derivatives at the location of the steepest slope for
the total three-dimensional cross-correlations, as well as those for
the inner halo term in the left and right hand panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:derivatives}, respectively. The logarithmic slope of the 
cross-correlation is significantly steeper than $-3$ at the location 
of the splashback radius, making it difficult to
be reproduced by classical fitting functions like the NFW profile,
which reach such slopes only asymptotically and even that only
without the presence of the outer 2-halo term. This provides
evidence for the existence of the splashback feature. From the second
derivative profiles we also note that the drop in the cross-correlation
signal is very sharp and happens within a factor 2 in radius.

We perform a preliminary comparison of the measurements with
expectations from cold dark matter models. The average halo mass of
the PSZ2 clusters as estimated from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal
is $M_{\rm 500c}=3.0\times10^{14}$ $\msunh$. We convert this mass
estimate to $M_{\rm 200m}=6.2\times10^{14}$ $\msunh$ using the average
concentration mass relation of halos following
\citet{HuKravtsov:2003}. Given the average mass and redshift of our
cluster sample, we calculate the expected splashback radius to be
$1.89$ $\mpch$. We base this estimate on the fitting functions
presented in \citet{more2015splashback}. The splashback radius we
find for the three samples is consistent with this expectation,
although we can not rule out $\sim 15\%$ deviations in either directions,
given our large error bars.

Next we present our measurements of the projected and
three-dimensional cross-correlations of the red and blue galaxy populations
satisfying $M_{i}-5\log h<-18.94$ with our SZ-selected cluster
sample. The projected cross-correlations are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:color_curve_2D},
whereas the three-dimensional counterparts are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:color_curve_3D}. The shaded regions show
the 68\% confidence intervals from our fits. The vertical, shaded
bands with different colors indicate the 68\% confidence regions of
the locations of the steepest slope of the two- and the
three-dimensional cross-correlations. The black dashed lines show
these ranges for the entire galaxy sample without regard to color.
The best fit parameters as well as the inferred splashback radii are
listed in Table~\ref{tab:fit_parameters}. We
see that the red galaxies have a steeper cross-correlation profile
than the blue galaxies. Although there seems to be  a tendency for the red
galaxies to have a smaller splashback radius, the differences we see
are not statistically significant given the current errors. The
slopes of the three-dimensional cross-correlations reach values
steeper than -2.5 at the splashback radius, which is difficult to model with
traditional NFW profiles. We take the detection of those steepening features 
as evidence for the existence of the splashback feature in both galaxy populations.
The finding of the splashback feature in the blue population implicates that
there needs to be a reasonable fraction of blue galaxies that fall
into the cluster and continue to stay blue even after reaching their
apocenters. Star forming galaxies in models which quench their star
formation on a timescale shorter than the orbital time scale are
not expected to show presence of the splashback feature. A
quantitative exploration of the implications is beyond the scope of
this work, but will be followed up in the future.

In Figure~\ref{fig:color_fraction}, we show the fractional
contributions of the red and blue galaxies to the total,
three-dimensional cross-correlation \footnote{The fractions are
obtained by performing an appropriate number density weighting.}.
The red galaxies dominate the central parts of the galaxy clusters
but become less dominant as we move further away from the cluster center.
We see an increase of the fractional contribution of
red galaxies below the splashback radius. On scales larger than the
splashback radius, the fractional contributions of the two populations become
very similar.

We note that, in principle it is possible that the blue galaxy population does not posses
a splashback feature but that due to our separation procedure outlined in Section~\ref{sec:Color}
some of the red galaxies are identified as blue ones and are contaminating the correlation function
of the blue population. Such a contamination could be caused by a scattering of some of the red galaxies
into the blue population due to the large photometric errors of the Pan-STARRS galaxies at faint magnitudes.
We tried to investigate the possiblity of that happening as outlined in 
Appendix~\ref{sec:Errors}. Unfortunately, we established that at the current state of the data we cannot
exclude such a contamination and the results derived using the color separated galaxy populations
should be used with caution therefore.

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:Future}

As it can be seen from Table~\ref{tab:snr}, the signal-to-noise
ratio of our measurement is lower when using the PS 22 catalog
compared to the other two estimates. This has two causes: Firstly,
the sky-coverage of the PS 22 catalog is $\approx$ 25\% lower than
for PS 21 and PS 21.5 since more regions had to be excluded due to
the survey depth being too low in those regions. Therefore, some
clusters from the PSZ2 catalog are missed when the PS 22 catalog is
exploited, which reduces the statistics. Secondly, as we consider
fainter galaxies, the contamination from background galaxies is
increased. This requires a better estimate of the uncorrelated
background component. A more precise estimation of the uncorrelated
background contamination would be possible by using a random galaxy
catalog in addition to the random cluster sample. This would allow
to use the more sophisticated Landy \& Szalay estimator
\citep{landy1993bias} to perform the background subtraction.

Another approach to increase the statistics of the measurements would 
be to increase the redshift range in which clusters are being considered. 
We chose $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.33$ in order to keep the analysis comparable 
to \citet{more2016detection}. However, this cut reduces the cluster sample 
size. Increasing the redshift range has its own limitations, though. 
It would be required to use a brighter magnitude limit for galaxies, 
which reduces the number of galaxies that can be used to infer the 
cross-correlation signal. This results in a trade-off which could be investigated
to find the optimal redshift range. Alternatively, other cluster samples that do 
not rely on optical cluster finding such as Xray based surveys might 
serve as independent and larger cluster samples. 
Another plausible approach would be to consider a smaller region of
the sky, resulting in less clusters but with a deeper field of view,
such as in the case of the Hyper Suprime-Cam at Subaru Telescope,
which will survey $\approx 1400$ deg$^2$ of the sky and achieve a
depth of 26.2 magnitudes \citep{takada2010subaru}.

The separation of the blue and red galaxy populations as described in 
Section~\ref{sec:Color} is prone to photometric errors. In order to 
assure our finding of a splashback feature in the blue galaxy population
a deeper galaxy catalog would be desirable. Again, the future survey
conducted with the Hyper Suprime-Cam could come to rescue.

Lastly, but most importantly, the investigation of any systematics
which might originate from the SZ selection of the Planck clusters
is beyond the scope of the current work. We caution that there may
be residual systematics in the selection which could affect the
interpretation of our measurements. We will investigate such
selection systematics with the help of hydrodynamical simulations.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}
The splashback radius of dark matter halos is a unique observational
probe of the mass accretion rate of dark matter halos. Although the
splashback radius has been well-characterized in simulations, the
observational evidence for the splashback radius presented using
optical cluster catalogs has come under intense scrutiny. In this
work, we tackle this issue by searching for evidence of the
splashback radius in galaxy clusters found by the Planck surveyor using
the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The use of this sample avoids
the circularity of using photometric galaxy catalogs to identify
clusters as well as to detect the splashback radius. 

We cross-correlate these clusters with photometric galaxies from the
Pan-STARRS survey to obtain the two-dimensional cross-correlation
function and search for evidence for the splashback feature.
Additionally, we divided our galaxy catalog into two subsamples of
red and blue galaxies and investigated the cross-correlations of the
two subsamples with the clusters, separately.

Our main findings can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We detect a clear signature of a steepening feature in the
cross-correlation of Planck SZ clusters with Pan-STARRS
galaxies. The steepest logarithmic slopes that we find in our cross-correlation
signals are steeper than $-3$, and would hence be poorly fit by the
NFW profile. We associate this steepening with the splashback feature.
\item The location of the inferred splashback radius is $r_{\rm
sp}=1.85_{-0.30}^{+0.26}$ $\mpch$, which is consistent with expectations
from numerical simulations for
halos of an average mass $M_{\rm 500c}=3.0\times10^{14}\msunh$ at an
average redshift of $z=0.18$ in a collision-less dark matter Universe. 
However, given the errors we cannot
currently rule out $\sim15\%$ deviations from these expectations.
\item We find that the location of the steepest slope does not
strongly depend on the magnitude of the galaxy samples we use, once
we go fainter than $M_i-5\log h=-19.44$.
\item By separately studying the cross-correlation of red and blue
galaxies with the clusters, we present evidence for the presence of
the splashback feature in both populations. This implies that the
star formation of a sizable number of blue galaxies does not get
quenched during their first orbit through the halo.
\item We also detect an increase in the fraction of red
galaxies associated with the splashback radius. 
\end{itemize}

Our curated galaxy catalogs from the Pan-STARRS survey for different
depths and the corresponding masks are available and can be sent
upon request.

\section{Estimating the contamination of the blue galaxy population}
\label{sec:Errors}
In our separation procedure of the blue from the red galaxy population 
we assume the photometric magnitudes of the Pan-STARRS galaxies to be exact.
However, photometric errors could cause red galaxies to scatter into the blue
population which contaminates the correlation function and might be the cause 
for the splashback feature observed in the blue population. Therefore, we 
investigate the possiblity of such a contamination. 

Firstly, we need to know how high such a contamination would have to be in order
to reproduce the splashback signal as seen in the observations given that the actual
blue poulation does not posses such a signal at all. We assume a simple $r^{-1.5}$ power 
law for the correlation signal of the blue population which by construction cannot cause a splashback feature. Then,
we simulate a contamination of the population by adding some of the accordingly rescaled 
correlation signal of the red population, which does posses a splashback feature.
We find that a contamination of at least 20\% is necessary to reproduce the observed
splashback signal.

Next we estimate the photometric errors of the Pan-STARRS galaxies in each one of the used
bands (namely $i_{PS}, g_{PS}, r_{PS}$). Since we chose galaxies with $15.0 \leq i_{PS} \leq 21.5$
for our analysis we consider the $i_{PS}$ errors as given in the Pan-STARRS survey of only 
the galaxies in this magnitude range. We fit a Gaussian to their distribution and use a conservative $3\sigma$ confidence
estimate for the photometric error in the $i_{PS}$ band. We repeat the same analysis for the
$g_{PS}$ and $r_{PS}$ bands, but using magnitude ranges which are shifted by the mean magnitude
differences between the $i_{PS}$ band and the $g_{PS}$ and $r_{PS}$ bands, respectively.
The histograms of the errors as well as the estimated photometric errors are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:photoerrors}. We find similar photometric errors in the $i_{PS}$ (63 mmag)
and $r_{PS}$ band (64 mmag) but a larger error in the $g_{PS}$ band of 81 mmag.

Finally, we estimate the contamination of the blue galaxy population given the cut in $g_{PS} - r_{PS}$
color that we used to separate the two populations. We start the same way as we established the cut:
By taking narrow redshift bins and then by binning the $g_{PS} - r_{PS}$ colors of the galaxies in each
redshift bin. Then we proceed by fitting a double Gaussian to the color distribution in each redshift bin
(indicated by the solid, accordingly colored lines in Figure~\ref{fig:histogram}). We put the cut which
separates the two distributions from each other at a $g_{PS} - r_{PS}$ color such that red galaxies are
excluded from being incorrectly characterized as blue galaxies at a confidence level of $3\sigma$ (indicated
by the solid, vertical, black line). At that point the fractional contribution of the red population reads 
$\sim 40\%$ which corresponds to a free field galaxy sample. In order to model the distribution inside of 
the cluster region we rescale the red distribution such that we end up with a fractional contribution of 
the red population of $65\%$. We do now take into account the estimated photometric errors in the $g_{PS}$ and
$r_{PS}$ bands by broadening the Gaussian distributions accordingly. The contamination is then estimated as:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{z=0.03}^{0.33} \int_{-\infty}^{cut(z)} 1 + \frac{\mathcal{N}_r(g-r)}{\mathcal{N}_b(g-r)} \mathrm{d}(g-r)
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all redshift bins, the integration is performed over the $g_{PS} - r_{PS}$ color up 
to the redshift dependent cut $cut(z)$ separating the two distributions and $\mathcal{N}_r(g-r)$ and $\mathcal{N}_b(g-r)$
representing the broadened Gaussian distributions of the red and blue population, respectively
(dashed, accordingly colored curves). With the described analysis we calculate a contamination of 24\%, which would
be high enough to explain the observed splashback signal of the blue galaxy population solely by red galaxies
that scattered into the blue population. However, this cannot be taken as disproof of the existence of a splashback
feature in the blue galaxy population. The contamination estimate strongly depenends on two factors: Firstly, on the 
confidence at which one wants to exclude red galaxies from being misidentified as blue galaxies and secondly on the
method one uses to estimate the photometric errors (magnitude range and the conservatism of the error estimate).
Depending on the approach we got contamination estimates ranging from 0.0001\% to 60\%. Therefore, at the current
state it cannot be concisely established if the observed splashback feature stems from a contamination of red
galaxies or not. A deeper galaxy catalog with smaller photometric errors, especially in the $g_{PS}$ band is
required to shed light on this matter.

whereas the dashed curves represent the Gaussian distributions broadened by the photometric errors of the Pan-STARRS
survey. The black, vertical line indicates the cut, separating the two galaxy populations as inferred from the original
distributions. The cut excludes red galaxies from being characterized as blue galaxies at $3/sigma$ confidence.}

\section{Modelling cluster mis-centering}
\label{sec:mis-centering}
As described in \citet{baxter2017halo} mis-centering of the central cluster 
positions are not expected to change the location of the splashback feature 
but might decrease the significance of the finding. Therefore, we modelled the 
effects of mis-centering on the correlation function and its influence on the results. 

The mass dependence of the exact mis-centering fractions are not
well understood and mis-centering effects are therefore difficult to 
model \citep{Skibba:2011, Hoshino:2015}. We follow the approach outlined 
in \citet{baxter2017halo} to take the effects of a possible mis-centering of a fraction 
of the cluster positions into account by modelling the influence on the two-dimensional correlation function.
 
Denoting the fraction of mis-centered clusters in the sample with $f_{\rm mis}$ we relate
the correlation function $\xi'_{\rm 2D}(R)$ that is affected by the mis-centering of the clusters to the correlation function
unaffected by mis-centering Equation~\ref{eq:surface} by

\begin{equation} 
\xi'_{\rm 2D}(R) = (1-f_{\rm mis})\xi_{\rm 2D}(R)+f_{\rm mis}\xi_{\rm (2D,mis)}(R)
\label{eq:full}
\end{equation}

where the contribution of the mis-centered clusters to the correlation function is captured by $\xi_{\rm (2D,mis)}$. 
We model the mis-centered component $\xi_{\rm (2D,mis)}$ as
 
\begin{equation}
\xi_{\rm (2D,mis)}(R)=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}R_{\rm mis} P(R_{\rm mis})\xi_{\rm (2D,mis)}(R|R_{\rm mis})
\end{equation}

where we assign a probability $P(R_{\rm mis})$ that a cluster is mis-centered by a comoving distance $R_{\rm mis}$.
The contribution $\xi_{\rm (2D,mis)}(R|R_{\rm mis})$ from a cluster mis-centered by a distance $R_{\rm mis}$ 
relates to the unaffected correlation function $\xi_{\rm 2D}$ as

\begin{equation}
\xi_{\rm (2D,mis)}(R|R_{\rm mis})=\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{2\pi}\xi_{\rm 2D}\left(\sqrt{R^2+R_{\rm mis}^2+2RR_{\rm mis}\cos{\theta}}\right)
\end{equation}

according to \citet{yang2006weak} and \citet{johnston2007cross}. Following \citet{simet2016weak} we model the mis-centering probability 
$P(R_{\rm mis})$ as a Rayleigh distribution:

\begin{equation}
P(R_{\rm mis})=\frac{R_{\rm mis}}{\sigma^2}\exp{\left( -\frac{R_{\rm mis}^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}
\end{equation}

Therefore, the mis-centered contribution is fully characterized by the two parameters $f_{\rm mis}$ and the witdh 
of the mis-centering probability distribution $\sigma$.

To find the priors for the two mis-centering paramters $f_{\rm mis}$ and $\sigma$ we cross-match our SZ selected cluster sample with the X-Ray selected ACCEPT cluster sample \citep{cavagnolo2009vizier}.
Assuming the ACCEPT clusters to lay at the true gravitational cluster centers we construct Gaussian priors
for the two mis-centering model parameters $f_{\rm mis}$ and $\sigma$ from the comparison of the 
two samples with central values 0.15, 0.41 and scales 0.21, 0.3 for $f_{\rm mis}$ and $\sigma$, respectively.

To study the influence of mis-centering on our findings we repeat the MCMC model fitting using our new model including mis-centering given in Equation~\ref{eq:full}, which now includes two more model parameters. 

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption{Listing of the splashback radii inferred by including the effects of mis-centering of the central cluster positions. }
    \label{tab:mis_splash}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline 
gal cat &  $R_{\mathrm{sp}}^{\mathrm{2D}}$ & $r_{\mathrm{sp}}^{\mathrm{3D}}$ \\
\hline 
\hline 
PS 21 &$1.35_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$ & $1.76_{-0.33}^{+0.29}$\\
\hline
PS 21.5 & $1.30_{-0.10}^{+0.10}$&$1.81_{-0.33}^{+0.28}$\\
\hline
PS 22 &$1.33_{-0.17}^{+0.13}$ & $1.96_{-0.45}^{+0.37}$\\
\hline
PS 21.5 (R) & $1.45_{-0.11}^{+0.12}$ & $2.23_{-0.26}^{+0.27}$ \\
\hline
PS 21.5 (B) & $1.42_{-0.25}^{+0.20}$ & $2.39_{-0.39}^{+0.39}$ \\
\hline
    \end{tabular} 
\end{table}

We find that due to the use of a projected mis-centering model the error bands of the MCMC estimate of the projected cross-correlation signal are increased by $\sim 25$\%. However, the effect is barely noticeable in the three-dimensional profiles. 
The inclusion of mis-centering is reflected as a small increase of the inferred errors of the projected and three-dimensional splashback radii as shown in Table~\ref{tab:mis_splash}. A small shift of the inferred central values of the splashback radii is recorded additionally. However, the shift is not systematic nor statistically significant.

\section{Sky maps}
\label{sec:figures}
We present the sky locations of the SZ selected clusters from the PSZ2
catalog that were used in our study in Figure~\ref{fig:planck_fig}.
The purple areas mark the masked out regions as defined by the union
selection function of the PSZ2 catalog. The sky maps in
Figure~\ref{fig:heal_map} show the survey masks of our three galaxy
catalogs. All sky maps presented in this section use the ICRS
coordinate system.

by the Pan-STARRS 3$\pi$ Steradian survey. The ICRS coordinate

affine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler of
\citet{goodman2010ensemble} as implemented in the parallel python
