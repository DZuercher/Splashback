 We restrict ourselves to the redshift range $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.33$ in order to mimic the redshift range used by \citet{more2016detection}. Due to the large beam size of the Planck satellite, the cluster positions as reported in the catalog may be miscentered from the true center of the galaxy clusters. We perform a visual inspection of Pan-STARRS images around the detected galaxy clusters in order to locate the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and assume that it is located at the true, gravitational center. The final sample we use consists of 596 galaxy clusters, and is about an order of magnitude smaller compared to the sample used in \citet{more2016detection}. The sample we use in this paper has an average redshift of 0.177, and an average cluster mass $M_{500c}$ of about $3.0 \cdot 10^{14} $h$^{-1}M_{\sun}$. In Table~\ref{tab:cluster_catalogs} we compare the main properties of the cluster catalog used in this work to that of \citet{more2016detection}. The sky positions of the clusters can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:planck_fig} in Appendix~\ref{sec:figures}. 
 
-\citet{Kosyra:2018} found no evidence for a significant correlation between the density of Planck detections and the weighted average noise of all Planck channels at $z<0.5$. Since we restrict ourselves to $z<0.33$, we utilize the selection mask of the PSZ2 union catalog in order to construct a random galaxy cluster catalog which is roughly 10 times larger than the original catalog. The redshifts of these random objects are drawn from the parent cluster catalog in order to match the redshift distribution of the original PSZ2 catalog.

 %The splashback radius manifests itself as a sharp steepening in the spatial density profile of a dark matter halo. Unfortunately, such profiles are not directly accessible through measurements. However, in the standard paradigm of structure formation it is assumed that galaxies track the underlying dark matter distribution since they form from baryonic matter falling into the potential wells created by the dark matter \citep{rees1977cooling,white1978core,fall1980formation,blumenthal1984formation}. Therefore, we use the radial galaxy distribution as a proxy for the dark matter distribution of a halo. A further complication arises by the fact that only the projected galaxy distribution within a halo is accessible as a projection of the three dimensional distribution onto a projection plane perpendicular to the line of sight. Therefore, the three dimensional model given in Equation~\ref{eq:model} needs to be integrated along the line of sight in order to obtain a model for the surface density profile:

 %Early studies have already revealed that quiescent, red sequence galaxies are found predominantely in the dense, inner regions of halos (e.g. \citep{oemler1974systematic}) and correlations between the galaxy properties and their small-scale environement, namely their host dark matter halos have been discovered \citep{blanton2009physical}. From a physcial perspective those correlations can be explained by quenching of the galaxies, which refers to the transition of an active star-forming, blue galaxy to a quiescent, red sequence galaxy. Several mechanisms influence the timescale and efficiency of the quenching; As a galaxy falls into a dark matter halo the stong gravitational forces not only prevent the galaxy from accreting but even strip dark matter from the galaxy's own halo (e.g. \citep{dekel2003galactic}). Moreover, the extended gas in the galaxy can be heated and stripped off as well which eventually diminishes the replenishment of the gas used up in the galaxy by star formation, a process that is referred to as 'strangulation' or 'starvation' \citep{larson1980evolution}. In an even more extreme case ram pressure can cause the gas to be stripped off from the galaxy's disc directly (e.g. \citep{chung2009vla};\citep{gunn1972infall}). As such processes happen mainly in the denser regions of the halo one expects to see an increase of red sequence galaxies on scales smaller than the splashback radius since galaxies located outside of the splashback radius are likely to be on their first infall onto the cluster \citep{baxter2017halo}. Other theories suggest that the color of the galaxy is unaffected by the environement of the galaxy but correlates only with the time of accretion of the galaxy onto the halo \citep{hearin2015beyond}. In this case one would still expect an increase in the red fraction below the splashback radius since the percentage of galaxies that have been splashed back at least once and therefore spent a considerable amount of time in the halo is significantly increased \citep{baxter2017halo}.
 %We investigate if such a correlation between the increase of the red fraction of galaxies and the splashback radius holds true by creating two galaxy subsamples from our main galaxy catalog, one containing red and the other containing blue galaxies, and studying their relative contributions to the overall density profile.  
 
-We are also interested in measuring the galaxy cluster-galaxy cross-correlations for the blue and the red galaxy samples, separately. We use a $g_{\mathrm{P1}}-r_{\mathrm{P1}}$ color cut which varies with the redshift of the clusters in order to account for the k-corrections which cannot be computed individually for each galaxy. We regard a galaxy as red if $g_{\mathrm{P1}}-r_{\mathrm{P1}} > 0.8 + 3.48(z_{\mathrm{clu}} - 0.1)$ and as blue otherwise. Depending upon the cluster redshift under consideration the same galaxy may be considered red/blue. Our method avoids the use of uncertain photometric redshifts to derive k-corrections \citep[cf.][]{Baxter:2017}. We will study the cross-correlations to derive the splashback radii for these galaxies separately, as well as study the fractional contribution of the red and the blue galaxies to the total profiles as a function of projected radius.

The logarithmic slope of the density profile is significantly steeper than $-3$, making it hard to be reproduced by the classical fitting functions like the NFW profile, which reach such slopes only asymptotically and that too without the presence of the outer 2-halo term. This provides evidence for the existence of the splashback feature.

-We perform a preliminary comparison of the measurements with expectations from cold dark matter models. The average halo mass of the Planck clusters as estimated from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal is $M_{\rm 500c}=3.0\times10^{14}\msunh$. We convert this mass estimate to $M_{\rm 200m}=6.2\times10^{14}\msunh$ using the average concentration mass relation of halos following \citet{HuKravtsov:2004}. Based on the fitting functions presented in \citet{more2015splashback}, the expected splashback redshift given the mass and the average redshift of our clusters is $1.89 \mpch$. The splashback radius we find for the three given samples is consistent with this expectation, although we can rule out $20\%$ deviations in either directions, given our large error bars.

The black dashed line show these locations for the entire galaxy sample without regard to color. The best fit parameters as well as the inferred splashback radii are listed in Table~\ref{tab:color_fit_parameters}. The right hand panels show the corresponding inferred logarithmic derivatives. We see that the red galaxies have a steeper cross-correlation profile than that of blue galaxies. Although there is a tendency for the red galaxies to have a smaller splashback radius, the differences we see are not statistically significant given the current errors. The slope of the three-dimensional cross-correlations reaches values steeper than -3 at the splashback radius.

-Nevertheless the fact that we detect the splashback radius for blue galaxies is significant. The implication of this result is that there needs to be a reasonable fraction of blue galaxies that fall into the cluster continue to stay blue even after reaching their apocenters. Star forming galaxies in models which quench their star formation on a timescale shorter than the orbital time scale, are not expected to show the presence of the splashback radius. A quantitative exploration for the implications is beyond the scope of this work, but will be followed up in the future.

We see a sharp increase of the fractional contribution of red galaxies below the splashback radius.

+\section{Discussion}
 \label{sec:Discussion}
+We find clear evidence for the presence of the splashback feature in clusters that were selected using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We now offer a preliminary comparison of the measurements with expectations from cold dark matter models. The average halo mass of the Planck clusters as estimated from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal is $M_{\rm 500c}=3.0\times10^{14}\sun$. We convert this mass estimate to a mass estimate $M_{\rm 200m}$ using the average concentration mass relation of halos.
 
-%Further, by comparison of the estimates of the splashback radius listed in Table~\ref{tab:splashbacks} with the expectation of $1.89 $ h$^{-1}$ Mpc for the three dimensional, physical splashback radius $r_{\mathrm{sp}}^{\mathrm{3D}}$ we can conclude that our results are in agreement with the theoretical prediction. On the contrary, we can not confirm the discrepancy between the theoretical and observed location of the splashback radius that was found by \citet{more2016detection} when correlating optically selected clusters with SDSS galaxies.
-
-%From the comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:3D_graphs} we can conclude that the choice of the depth of the catalog does not alter the shapes of the density profiles significantly nor does it change the location of the splashback radius in a systematic manner. 
-
-% Move into future work section:
-As can be seen from Table~\ref{tab:snr}, the SNR of our measurements is lower when using the PS 22 catalog compared to the other two estimates. This has two causes: First, the sky-coverage of the PS 22 catalog is $\approx$ 25\% lower than for PS 21 and PS 21.5 since more regions had to be excluded due to the depth of the survey being too low in those regions. Therefore, some clusters from the PSZ2 catalog are missed when the PS 22 catalog is exploited, which reduces the statistics. Secondly, as we consider fainter galaxies, the background galaxy contamination is increased. This requires a better estimate of the uncorrelated background component. A more precise estimation of the uncorrelated background contamination would be possible by using a random galaxy catalog in addition to the random cluster sample. This would allow to use the more sophisticated Landy \& Szalay estimator to perform the background subtraction.
-% (see Section~\ref{sec:est_surf_den}). 
-
-Another possible way to increase the statistics of the measurements would be to increase the redshift range in which clusters are being considered. We chose $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.33$ in order to keep the analysis similar to \citet{more2016detection}. However, this cut reduces the cluster sample size from 1653 to 596. Increasing the redshift range has its own limitations, though. We will have to go with a brighter magnitude limit for galaxies used in the cross-correlation. This results in a trade-off and we could investigate the optimal redshift range. Alternatively, other cluster samples that do not rely on optical cluster finding such as X-ray based surveys might serve as independent and larger cluster samples. 
-%We are considering to use the meta-catalog of X-ray detected clusters of galaxies (MCXC) which combines sevaral X-Ray based cluster catalogs for further investigations. The catalog is based on the ROSAT All-Sky survey \citep{voges1999rosat}. 
-Another plausible approach would be to consider a smaller region of the sky, meaning also less clusters but with a deeper field of view such as in the case of the Hyper Suprime-Cam at Subaru Telescope which will survey $\approx 1400$ deg$^2$ of the sky and achieve a depth of 26.2 magnitudes \citep{takada2010subaru}.

We achieve good agreement between the standard and the deprojection procedure on scales below $2$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc but record a significant disagreement on larger scales. Therefore, we conclude that the general procedure is working but requires improvement. We suspect that including effects from masking and survey boundaries into the deprojection algorithm could improve the agreement. The procedure to do so is outlined in Section~\ref{sec:deprojection_math} but was not implemented so far. 
+ Further, by comparison of the estimates of the splashback radius listed in Table~\ref{tab:splashbacks} with the expectation of $1.89 $ h$^{-1}$ Mpc for the three dimensional, physical splashback radius $r_{\mathrm{sp}}^{\mathrm{3D}}$ we can conclude that our results are in agreement with the theoretical prediction. On the contrary, we can not confirm the discrepancy between the theoretical and observed location of the splashback radius that was found by \citet{more2016detection} when correlating optically selected clusters with SDSS galaxies.
 
-% I do not agree with this paragraph. I will tell you why later on.
-%From Figure~\ref{fig:color_fraction} we can confirm that the splashback feature is strongly associated with a sharp increase in the red fraction as it was observed by \citet{baxter2017halo} before. On the contrary, \citet{baxter2017halo} find that the density profile of the blue population reaches a constant logarithmic derivative of -1.5 at large radii outside of the splashbak radius, as it would be expected for purely in-falling material. This is not reproduced in our study where the density profile of the blue population flattens out further and reaches logarithmic derivatives below -1. We propose that this deviation from a purely in-falling population of galaxies might be caused by group preprocessing: preprocessing referrs to a situation where a galaxy is in-falling onto a large halo but has been acrreated onto a smaller subhalo before which itself is being accreated onto the larger halo at the time of observation. In such a scenario, the galaxy seems to be on its first in-fall but has actually passed through the central part of a smaller subhalo before \citep{fujita2004pre}. Therefore, the quenching of the galaxy started earlier and it might have already changed to a red sequence galaxy before reaching the splashback radius of the large halo. It was found by \citet{wetzel2013galaxy} that such galaxies make up for at least 30\% of the quiescent galaxies in a cluster which can increase to over 50\% for massive clusters above $10^{14} M_{\sun}$. Since mainly massive clusters are studied in this work we expect a large contribution from preprocessed galaxies which could explain the discrepancy from \citet{baxter2017halo}. We note that our investigations on the distributions of the blue and red subpopulations are far from complete. A thorough study would have to take into account the different masses and velocities of the individual galaxies in order to get a more precise picture. We note as well that we used a very simple, idealistic way to separate the galaxy catalog in subsamples relying on only two photometric bands and that a considering more bands might improve the results.
+From the comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:3D_graphs} we can conclude that the choice of the depth of the catalog does not alter the shapes of the density profiles significantly nor does it change the location of the splashback radius in a systematic manner. However, as can be seen from Table~\ref{tab:snr} the SNR is lower when using the PS 22 catalog compared to the other two estimates. This has two causes: Firstly, the sky-coverage of the PS 22 catalog is $\approx$ 25\% lower than for PS 21 and PS 21.5 since more regions had to be excluded due to the depth of the survey being too low in those regions. Therefore, some clusters from the PSZ2 catalog are missed when the PS 22 catalog is exploited, which reduces the statistics. Secondly, by increasingly considering fainter galaxies the contribution of the background galaxies raises, which requires better estimation of the uncorrelated background component. A more precise estimation of the uncorrelated background contamination would be possible by using a random galaxy catalog in addition to the random cluster sample. This would allow to use the more sophisticated Landy \& Szalay estimator to perform the background subtraction (see Section~\ref{sec:est_surf_den}). 
 
-% Already included before.
-%Although, we find good agreement with the theory it would be premature to jump to conclusions about the nature of the splashback radius from this study. Due to the small cluster sample used in this work we achieve much lower statistic than \citet{more2016detection}. As evident from Table~\ref{tab:splashbacks} our estimates of the splashback radii suffer from relative errors of $\approx$ 15\%. 
+A possible way to increase the statistics of the measurements would be to increase the redshift range in which clusters are being considered. We chose $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.33$ in order to keep our results comparable with \citet{more2016detection} but this cut reduces the cluster sample size from 1653 to 596. However, considering higher redshift clusters would reduce the number of galaxies considered in the survey due to the condition given in Equation~\ref{eq:constraint}. This introduces a trade-off and requires some investigation to find the best redshift range. Alternatively, other cluster samples that do not rely on optical cluster finding such as X-ray based surveys might serve as independent and larger cluster samples. As such, we are considering to use the meta-catalog of X-ray detected clusters of galaxies (MCXC) which combines sevaral X-Ray based cluster catalogs for further investigations. The catalog is based on the ROSAT All-Sky survey \citep{voges1999rosat}. Another plausible approach would be to consider a smaller region of the sky, meaning also less clusters but with a deeper field of view such as in the case of the Hyper Suprime-Cam at Subaru Telescope which monitors $\approx 2000$ deg$^2$ of the sky and achieves a depth of 26.2 magnitudes \citep{takada2010subaru}.
 
-In our work, we have assumed that the brightest central galaxy resides at rest with respect to the center of the dark matter halo. The mass dependence of the exact miscentering fractions are not very well understood \citep{Skibba:2011, Hoshino:2016}. \citet{Baxter:2017} have shown that miscentering effects could in principle decrease the significance of the evidence of the splashback radius, but does not affect the location of the splashback radius, significantly. Nevertheless we plan to pursue models including miscentering to fit to our measurements.
+\citet{baxter2017halo} showed that if the splashback feature is present, one can expect that the density profile $\rho$ as well as the density profile of the collapsed material $\rho_{\mathrm{in}}f_{\mathrm{trans}}$ experience a logarithmic slope significantly smaller than -3 at the splashback radius $r_{\mathrm{sp}}^{\mathrm{3D}}$. This cannot be reproduced by classical fitting functions like the NFW profile, which approaches a minimal derivative of -3 at large scales. From the  binned distribution of the logarithmic derivatives at the splashback radii in Figure~\ref{fig:derivatives} we can see that this claim is consistent with our findings for both logarithmic derivatives. This provides further evidence for the existence of the splashback feature.
 
-%Apart, from statistical errors there are also multiple systematic sources of errors that have to be investigated more thoroughly before we can draw any definitive conclusions from our results: Although, the central cluster positions have been adjusted manually it can not be guaranteed that the corrected positions are at the actual centers of the clusters. Firstly, the visual inspection is prone to human error of course and secondly it is assumed that the gravitational center of the cluster lays at the same position as the brightest central galaxy, which might not be true in general. The effect of such misplacements might be investigated by artificially displace some subsample of the clusters and study the influence on the location of the splashback radius.

-% This is irrelevant because the stars are not correlated with the galaxy clusters, so should drop out.
-%Regarding the galaxy catalog, the exploited star-galaxy separation is of very simplistic nature and the extracted catalog might still suffer from contaminations from stars. It might be worth to consider a more sophisticated separation method.

-% This is very commonly known, so not necessary to be stated.
-%Some tests outlined in Section~\ref{sec:convergence} have been exploited to investigate the mixing behavior and convergence of the MCMC chains used in the fitting procedure as described in Section~\ref{sec:MCMC}. However, it has to be noted that there is no mathematical tool available, that can confirm the convergence of MCMC chains without fail. Therefore, although the performed tests suggest that the chains are convergent we can not exclude that they may have not reached a static distribution.

 Lastly, but most importantly: We did not investigate any systematics whatsoever which might originate from the PSZ2 clusters. There might be systematic effects present which have similar or even greater impact on our measurements than the systematics encountered in the optical cluster finding procedure. For the investigation of such systematics hydrodynamical simulations would have to be performed, potentially.
