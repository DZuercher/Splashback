We thank the referee for the very detailed and useful report. We have made the
changes based on the referee's detailed suggestions, and these changes should
have improved the readability of the paper. We hope the revised manuscript is
in an acceptable format. In our response below, the referees comments have been
quoted, and our response indicated by Reply.

Please let us know if there are any further concerns.

Reply: We thank the referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and the
detailed suggestions which have helped improve the paper.

Reply: Our original motivation to keep Figure 1 in the beginning was to show the
average redshift of the sample and the mass range, since that goes in our
theoretical expectation. However since this is indicated in the Table, we have
now moved Figure 1 to the appendix based on the referee's suggestion.

Reply: We thank the referee for this suggestion. We have now combined Figure 2
and Figure 3 in the original manuscript into one. However, since the upper two
panels have the projected radius as the abscissa while the bottom three have
the 3-dimensional radius instead, we have included the labels at the bottom of
row 2, and row 5 separately. We have also included a label Rsp^{\rm 2d} and
Rsp^{\rm 3d} to indicate the two and three dimensional locations of the
steepest slopes, since it could be confusing. We have similarly combined Figure
6 and 7 into the new Figure 4.

Reply: We agree and have described this table in the text instead.

Reply: We apologize that the right panel in Figure 4 was inadvertently included
in the original manuscript. We have now removed that part and combined Figure 4
and 5 into a single one and included large labels inside the panels explaining
what each of the distribution corresponds to.

Reply: We agree and have changed the figure as suggested.

Reply: We agree with the referee's suggestion and have included one of the
corner plots in the main manuscript and the others have been removed from the
appendix. We have also included some messages that we want the reader to take
from these plots in the text describing this figure.

Reply: We agree that the figure 15 corresponding to the error as a function of
magnitude may not be necessary, but we would like to show the color cut we use
for reproducibility purposes. We hope the referee will be ok with this.

Reply: We have now included sentences to this effect in the abstract, the
introduction as well as just before Section 2.1.

Reply: We would like to apologize for missing these citations. We have now
pointed out these alternative ways of defining the splashback radius in the
Methods section, along with the relevant citations.

Reply: We have now added comments relevant to dynamical friction effects in the
introduction itself now.

Reply: We have now added the relevant comments in the methods section.

Reply: We have now kept only one of the corner plots, and have written the main
takeaways from the plot in the Results section of the text.

Reply: We have now added a note discussing our results with those in Baxter et
al. 2017.

Reply: This was an erroneous plot, we apologize for not noticing this before,
and thank the referee for noticing it.

Reply: We have corrected this.

Reply: The noisy looking derivatives were a result of us avoiding the large
computational cost of storing the derivatives at a large number of radial
points at every MCMC step. We have now taken the computed points, and plotted
the spline instead and are displaying it in the Figure to avoid this noise in
the derivative figure.

Reply: Done

Reply: We now mention the model of concentration-mass relation we use.

Reply: We have added the y-labels and increased the size of the inset labels.

Reply: We have now edited this.

Reply: We have added the Rsp values computed without miscentering in Table 6, as suggested.
